# ITP341FinalProject
This is an Android mobile application I made for my ITP 341 final at USC. 
It is an application that allows a user to create an "Incident" to represent a safety concern that the USC student community 
should be concerned with. For example, if a student was walking home from campus and had someone steal their backpack,
they could create an "Incident" and mark the location in which it happened and at what time. This incident will then 
show up on the Maps tab.
All users of this application can check the Maps tab to be aware of any incidents that have occurred in their immediate area. 
This will help students become more informed and aware of their community and any saftey concerns. 

This application was designed to increase communication and awareness for the USC community which currently faces many
security issues and threats. 

Please feel free to download and check out the code!
